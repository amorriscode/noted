# Noted

A simple application built for storing notes. I chose to use the VueJS because it is lightweight, easy to understand and use, and is extremely quick. It uses Firebase allowing us to enjoy that real-time experience.

This app was built for a technical assessment, but if you feel like adding or requesting features, drop me a PR or feature request!

### How to use

1. Click the plus to add a note

2. Double click a note to edit

### Build Instructions

_In previous projects I had used a [webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) to get going fast. This time, however, I wanted to learn what was under the hood._

1. Followed an [article on building a Vue project from scratch](https://skyronic.com/blog/vue-project-scratch)

2. Article was out of date so [followed the fixes that someone else had found](https://gist.github.com/mjhanninen/d9cb707c6419588f36b93a936470aeae)

3. Changed `webpack.config.js` file to use `vue-loader` instead of `vue` to load Vue files

4. Implemented Firebase using the firebase-tools
  * Run using `firebase serve`
  * Deploy using `firebase deploy`

### Things I want to add...

* Share notes between users
* WYSIWYG editor
* Find and crush the bugs
* Enhance design (practice animations, etc.)
* Add notifications
