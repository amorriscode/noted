# Noted

A simple application built for storing notes. I chose to use the VueJS because it is lightweight, easy to understand and use, and is extremely quick. It uses Firebase allowing us to enjoy that real-time experience.

This app was built for a technical assessment, but if you feel like adding or requesting features, drop me a PR or feature request!

### Build Instructions

_In previous projects I had used a [webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) to get going fast. This time, however, I wanted to learn what was under the hood._

1. Followed an [article on building a Vue project from scratch](https://skyronic.com/blog/vue-project-scratch)

2. Article was out of date so [followed the fixes that someone else had found](https://gist.github.com/mjhanninen/d9cb707c6419588f36b93a936470aeae)

3. Changed `webpack.config.js` file to use `vue-loader` instead of `vue` to load Vue files
